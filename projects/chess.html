                    <h2>Chess Without the Clutter</h2>
                    <p>
                        I love chess—not the competitive, metric-tracking, rating-chasing kind of chess, but the casual, conversation-over-coffee kind. The game you play with friends while catching up, where the board is just an excuse to spend time together. I wanted that same casual experience on my phone for those spare moments throughout the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem? Every chess app I found was either bloated with features for serious players—opening databases, performance analytics, puzzle trainers—or so old and outdated it felt like it was pulled from 2008. I didn't need all those bells and whistles. I just wanted a clean, elegant chess app that worked well and got out of the way.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Just the Board, Nothing Else</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you open the app, you see the board. That's it. No menus, no sidebars, no floating buttons. Move a piece by dragging or tapping—whichever feels natural. If you're in check, a subtle indicator appears on your side of the board. Everything else stays out of sight until you need it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting a new game required special attention. I didn't want a jarring "reset" button or confirmation dialog that breaks the experience. Instead, you press and hold below the board. A bubble grows smoothly, pauses for a moment, then pops. The current board slides off the screen, and a fresh game glides in from the right.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="pullquote">
                        <p>The bubble animation had to feel natural—timing, easing, and visual weight all mattered.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Getting that animation right took days of iteration. The bubble needed to expand at just the right speed, pause long enough to give you a chance to release if you changed your mind, and pop with satisfying finality. The board transition had to feel smooth and deliberate, not abrupt. These micro-interactions transform the app from functional to enjoyable.

                <h2>Building with React and Stockfish</h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a React Progressive Web App built with Create React App. The chess logic comes from two excellent libraries: <code>react-chessboard</code> for rendering a highly customizable board, and <code>chess.js</code> for managing game state, legal moves, and win conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything else is orchestrated by a custom hook I built called <code>useGame</code>. This hook provides the React components with all the game state they need—current position, legal moves, check status, whose turn it is—along with functions to interact with the game like making moves, requesting engine analysis, and resetting the board.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stockfish is the most powerful open-source chess engine in the world. It's written in C++, which means it can't run directly in a browser without compiling to WebAssembly—a path that felt overly complex for this project. Instead, I built a small Python service using FastAPI to act as a bridge between the browser and Stockfish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The API has just one endpoint. The frontend sends the current game state in FEN notation—a compact text format that encodes the entire board position. The backend passes that to Stockfish, waits for it to calculate the best move, and returns the result. The engine is tuned to play at my level, which means I win about half the time.

                <p>
                    The app is a PWA, which means it can be installed on your home screen and feels like a native app. The board and game logic work offline since <code>chess.js</code> runs entirely in the browser. The only time you need a connection is when requesting a move from the Stockfish backend.

                <p>
                    Right now, the app is a minimal viable product. You can play against the engine at a fixed difficulty, and your color is chosen randomly when you start a new game. It's intentionally simple, but there are features I'd like to add—undo moves, move suggestions, difficulty selection, color choice, and move history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, it would be interesting to add multiplayer—playing real people instead of just the engine. The challenge isn't adding functionality; it's doing so in a way that preserves the elegant, uncluttered feel of the current design.

                <h3 class="section-heading-spacing">What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    This project taught me a lot about animation and polish. Getting the bubble reset animation to feel natural required careful attention to timing curves, visual weight, and user feedback. The board slide transitions needed to be smooth and deliberate, not jarring. These details take time, but they're what separate a functional app from an enjoyable one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also my first time deploying a React app alongside a backend service. I learned to deploy the frontend on AWS Amplify and the Python backend on Google Cloud Run—both effectively free for this scale. And working with Stockfish gave me my first exposure to chess engines, FEN notation, and wrapping a C++ binary in a REST API.
